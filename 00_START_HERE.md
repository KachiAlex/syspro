## 🚀 What's Working

### ✅ Complete CRUD Operations
- Create expense with tax calculation
- Read single or list with filters
- Update with partial changes
- Delete with cascade

### ✅ 3-Level Approval Workflow
```
≤ ₦50,000         → 1 approval (Manager)
₦50K - ₦500K     → 2 approvals (Manager + Finance)
> ₦500K          → 3 approvals (all levels)
```

### ✅ Tax Handling
- VAT (7.5%) → GL 1050 (recoverable)
- WHT (5%) → GL 2080 (payable)
- Auto-calculated on creation

### ✅ GL Posting (6 Scenarios)
1. Vendor (no tax)
2. Vendor + VAT
3. Professional + WHT
4. Employee Reimbursement
5. Prepaid Expense (multi-period)
6. Cash Expense

### ✅ Reporting
- Summary (totals, metrics)
- By Category (breakdown)
- Aged (time buckets)
- Tax Summary (VAT/WHT analysis)

### ✅ Budget Control
- Category-level limits
- Usage tracking
- 80% warning threshold
- 95% critical threshold

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Every action logged
- User tracking
- Timestamp recording
- Change history
