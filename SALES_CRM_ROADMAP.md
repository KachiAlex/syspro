- **Option B**: Unified Customer table with lead_status field
- **Recommendation**: Option A (cleaner, matches requirement)

### 2. Activity Types
- **Option A**: Single activities table with type field
- **Option B**: Separate tables for calls, emails, meetings
- **Recommendation**: Option A (simpler, more flexible)

### 3. Pipeline Flexibility
- **Option A**: Fixed pipeline stages (hardcoded)
- **Option B**: Configurable pipelines per company
- **Recommendation**: Option B (more enterprise-ready)

### 4. Pricing Integration
- **Option A**: CRM reads from Product module
- **Option B**: CRM has its own price book tables
- **Recommendation**: Option A (single source of truth)
