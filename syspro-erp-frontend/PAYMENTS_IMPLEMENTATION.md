## 🎯 What We've Built

### 1. Enhanced Payment Data Model

The `PaymentRecord` type now includes enterprise features:

```typescript
type PaymentRecord = {
  id: string;                                          // Unique payment ID
  payableId: string;                                   // Linked payable
  customerId?: string;                                 // Customer reference
  invoiceId?: string;                                  // Invoice reference
  method: "bank_transfer" | "check" | "cash" | "pos" | "mobile_money" | "wire" | "paystack" | "flutterwave" | "stripe";
  grossAmount: string;                                 // Pre-fee amount
  fees: string;                                        // Gateway/processing fees
  netAmount: string;                                   // Amount actually received
  currency: string;                                    // Currency (NGN, etc.)
  paymentDate: string;                                 // When payment was made
  settlementDate?: string;                             // When funds cleared
  referenceNumber: string;                             // Bank ref, check #, transaction ID
  gatewayReference?: string;                           // Payment gateway transaction ID
  confirmationDetails: string;                         // Receipt/confirmation info
  status: "pending" | "successful" | "failed" | "reversed";
  gateway?: "paystack" | "flutterwave" | "stripe" | "manual";
  linkedInvoices: string[];                            // Invoice allocation
  recordedBy: string;                                  // Who recorded it
  recordedDate: string;                                // When recorded
  auditTrail: {                                        // Full audit history
    action: string;
    timestamp: string;
    user: string;
  }[];
};
```

### 2. Sample Payment Data

4 complete payment records in `PAYMENT_RECORDS_BASELINE`:
- ✅ Manual bank transfer (settled)
- ✅ Paystack gateway payment (settled)
- ✅ Check payment (pending settlement)
- ✅ Flutterwave payment (settled)

Each includes:
- Proper fee calculations
- Settlement tracking
- Audit trails
- Gateway references
- Linked invoices

## 🏗️ Next Steps for UI Implementation

### Phase 1: Dashboard (4 metrics)
**Goal**: Replace 3-column stat box with 4-column dashboard

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Payments Dashboard                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Total Received    │ Pending   │ Failed     │ Success│
│ ₦18.96M          │ ₦2.34M   │ ₦0         │ 80%    │
│ 2 settled        │ 1 items  │ 0 items    │ Fees   │
│                  │          │            │ ₦0.045M│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Calculated from payments state:
- **Total Received**: Sum of `netAmount` where `status === "successful"`
- **Pending**: Sum of `grossAmount` where `status === "pending"`
- **Failed**: Sum of `grossAmount` where `status === "failed"`
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful payments + total fees charged

### Phase 2: Enhanced Table (9 columns)
**Current**: 6 columns (vendor, amount, due date, status, branch, actions)
**Target**: 9 columns (reference, gross, fees, net, method, gateway, status, date, actions)

```
Reference    │ Gross      │ Fees    │ Net        │ Method      │ Gateway    │ Status    │ Date       │ Actions
TRF-001      │ ₦145,000   │ ₦1,450  │ ₦143,550   │ Bank Trans. │ Manual     │ ✓ Success │ 2024-02-01 │ ⋮
PS-20240131  │ ₦892,500   │ ₦26,776 │ ₦865,724   │ Paystack    │ Paystack   │ ✓ Success │ 2024-01-31 │ ⋮
CHK-000456   │ ₦2,340,000 │ ₦0      │ ₦2,340,000 │ Check       │ Manual     │ ⏳ Pending │ 2024-02-04 │ ⋮
```

### Phase 3: Payment Detail Drawer
**Trigger**: Click table row
**Layout**: 8 sections in right sidebar

1. **Header**: Payment ID, Reference, Status
2. **Summary**: Gross, Fees, Net (highlighted)
3. **Payment Info**: Method, Gateway, Date Received
4. **Settlement**: Settlement Date (if applicable)
5. **Linked Invoices**: Badge chips showing linked invoices
6. **Activity Log**: Audit trail (created, settled, modified)
7. **Gateway Details**: Gateway reference if available
8. **Action Buttons**: Print receipt, download statement

### Phase 4: Record Payment Modal
**Trigger**: "+ Record Payment" button
**Fields**:

- Payment Method (dropdown) - bank_transfer, check, cash, mobile_money, paystack, flutterwave, stripe
- Gross Amount (number) *required
- Fees (number, default 0)
- Currency (dropdown, default NGN)
- Payment Date (date picker) *required
- Reference Number (text) *required - e.g., TRF-20240201-001
- Gateway Reference (conditional - show only for paystack/flutterwave/stripe)
- Confirmation Details (textarea) *required
- Submit Button: "Record Payment"

## 📊 Dashboard Calculations

```typescript
const metrics = {
  totalReceived: payments
    .filter(p => p.status === "successful")
    .reduce((sum, p) => sum + parseFloat(p.netAmount), 0),
    
  pendingAmount: payments
    .filter(p => p.status === "pending")
    .reduce((sum, p) => sum + parseFloat(p.grossAmount), 0),
    
  failedAmount: payments
    .filter(p => p.status === "failed")
    .reduce((sum, p) => sum + parseFloat(p.grossAmount), 0),
    
  totalFees: payments
    .filter(p => p.status === "successful")
    .reduce((sum, p) => sum + parseFloat(p.fees), 0),
    
  settledCount: payments
    .filter(p => p.status === "successful" && p.settlementDate)
    .length,
    
  successRate: ((payments.filter(p => p.status === "successful").length / payments.length) * 100)
};
```

## 🔄 Payment Lifecycle

```
PENDING → SUCCESSFUL → SETTLED
        └→ FAILED   → REVERSED
```

- **Pending**: Payment recorded but not confirmed (checks, ACH)
- **Successful**: Payment confirmed by gateway or manual verification
- **Settled**: Funds deposited in bank account
- **Failed**: Payment rejected/declined
- **Reversed**: Payment reversed/refunded after settlement

---

## 🎨 UI Filters

1. **Status Filter**: All Status | Pending | Successful | Failed | Reversed
2. **Method Filter**: All Methods | Bank Transfer | Check | Cash | Mobile Money | Paystack | Flutterwave | Stripe
3. **Gateway Filter**: All Gateways | Manual | Paystack | Flutterwave | Stripe
4. **Search**: By reference number or customer ID

---

## 🔐 Immutability & Audit

- Successful/Settled payments are read-only
- All changes logged in `auditTrail`
- Timestamps recorded (ISO 8601)
- User tracked for all actions

---

## 🚀 Gateway Integration Foundation

Current structure ready for:

1. **Paystack**: `gateway: "paystack"`, `gatewayReference: "ch_xxxxxxxx"`
2. **Flutterwave**: `gateway: "flutterwave"`, `gatewayReference: "tx_xxxxxxxx"`
3. **Stripe**: `gateway: "stripe"`, `gatewayReference: "pi_xxxxxxxx"`

Webhooks would:
- Verify signature
- Create PaymentRecord with gateway reference
- Set status to "successful"
- Update settlement date on settlement event

  - Added `PaymentRecord` type with comprehensive fields
  - Created `PAYMENT_RECORDS_BASELINE` with 4 sample payments
  - Imported `CheckCircle2` icon (already imported, just needed alias)
