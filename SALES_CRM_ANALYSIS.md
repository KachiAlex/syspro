## 🎯 Key Differences vs Other Modules

### What Makes CRM Different

1. **Relationship-Heavy**: Multiple entities linked (Lead→Contact→Account→Deal)
2. **Status-Driven**: Pipelines, stages, workflow states
3. **Activity-Centric**: Every action tracked (calls, emails, meetings)
4. **Performance-Focused**: Revenue, metrics, forecasting
5. **Flow-Based**: Lead→Deal→Quote→Order→Invoice→Payment

### What's Similar
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Role-based access
- Approval workflows
- Financial integration
- Reporting framework

---

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

### Build CRM As A New Module
- **Separate** from Assets, Reports, Accounting
- **Integrate** with existing GL, invoicing
- **Reuse** patterns from existing modules
- **Follow** same architecture (Service layer → API → Components)

### Phased Rollout
- **Phase 1**: Leads, Accounts, Contacts (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: Opportunities, Quotes, Orders (Revenue Flow)
- **Phase 3**: Activities, Performance (Engagement)
- **Phase 4**: Approvals, Analytics (Control)

### Quality Focus
- Type safety (Zod schemas)
- Error handling
- Input validation
- Audit trails
- Performance optimization

## 📝 Summary

### Current State
✅ Assets & Depreciation (100%)  
✅ Financial Reports (93%)  
✅ Accounting Core (60%)  
✅ Budgets (50%)  
✅ Expenses (partially)  
✅ Vendor Mgmt (partial)  

### Gap
❌ **Sales & CRM Module (0%)**

### Effort to Build CRM
- **Code**: ~5,800 lines
- **Time**: 6-7 weeks (or 4 weeks intensive)
- **Phases**: 4 phases, starting with foundation
- **Reuse**: ~60% of patterns from existing modules

### Critical Path
Phase 1 (Leads/Accounts/Contacts) → Phase 2 (Pipeline/Quotes/Orders) → Phase 3 (Activities/Reports) → Phase 4 (Approvals)

Would you like me to start building Phase 1 (Leads, Accounts, Contacts foundation)?
